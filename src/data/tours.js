A straight street connected the only town gates with the gates of the citadel. The Mausoleum of Abu Said Mekhneyi was built in 11th century and has the double dome that characterizes mausoleums of that time. The inner part of the mausoleum is decorated with inscriptions while the portal is laced with mosaics. The mosaics offer various colors and pictures to the viewer. The entire mausoleum is decorated with Arabic inscriptions upon the outer area and designs ornate in inner areas. Overnight in Mary.`,

After the Koran, the book most revered by Muslims is the collection of Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammed) selected by, among others, Abu Abdullah Muhammed ibn Ismail Imam Al-Bukhori. Born in Bukhara in 810, the young boy showed a precocious talent for memorizing the traditions of Muhammed. At 16 he accompanied his mother and brother in the hadj pilgrimage to Mecca. They returned home without him, for Al-Bukhori was set on his chosen task of roaming the Islamic world in search of Hadith. His 97-book masterpiece took 16 years to compile from over 600,000 traditions, gathered from over 1000 sheikhs. He would not insert a text without first washing and praying. In addition to Muhammed's life, Al-Bukhori explained the creation of heaven and hell. Though his veracity and peerless knowledge were recognized in his lifetime, his popularity and independent spirit drew enemies in Persia that forced him back to Bukhara. Al-Bukhori wished to keep learning open to all who attended his mosque, so he refused private tuition for the Bukharian governor's children. His subsequent expulsion brought him to the village of Hartang outside Samarkand. Depressed by his treatment, the old master was heard one night in 870 to pray for God to release him. Within a month he was dead.

				text: `After late breakfast visit Old Tashkent and Kukeldash Madrassah will be the first to see. Built in the mid-16th century by the ruler's vizier Kukaldash, the madrassah was the biggest among 17 madrassahs in Tashkent. The Madrassah was built in very traditional style, just so any madrassah is built in any Muslim country.  After secular use as a Soviet warehouse and museum, the madrassah is reasserting religious role. Next to Kukeldash Madrassah there are three renewed domes – reconstructed city's chief Friday Mosque, named after Khodja Akhrar (1404-1490) – Chief Sheikh of powerful Sufic order of Naqshbandi. Original mosque was built in 15 century on the highest point in old Tashkent and was the third biggest in Central Asia. Afterward drive to Kukcha district and visit the oldest architectural Islamic monument in Tashkent – Mausoleum of Zaynutdun Bobo.  Sheikh Zaynutdin was a son of famous in Muslim world philosopher and poet Shikhabuddin as-Sukhravardi, direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammed. Zaynutdin was born in Bagdad in 1214. In the middle of 13 century he moved to Tashkent and as legend says lived in subterranean cell (chillya khona) in Kuhi Arifon (Hill of wise men) village near Tashkent. Sheikh Zaynutdin was much respected and after his death a mausoleum was erected. His mausoleum was reconstructed and rebuilt many times due to earthquakes. The building, which can be seen now, was built in 16 century, but the subterranean cell was built much earlier, in 12th century. Also visit Khast Imam Square – the holy heart of Tashkent and the least Russified or Sovietized part of the city – consisting of Barak Khan Madrassah, Tillya Sheykh Mosque and Kafal Shashi Mausoleum. Barak Khan founded in the 16th century by a descendent of Tamerlane who ruled Tashkent for the Shaybanid dynasty. This is the administrative center of the Mufti of Uzbekistan, the head of official Islam in the Republic. Tillya Sheykh mosque built in the same time as Barak Khan Madrassah, now employed as the district's Friday Mosque. The highlight is the immense Osman Koran, claimed to be the world's oldest; in 655 it was stained with the blood of the murdered Caliph Osman. Kafal Shashi mausoleum – the grave of a local doctor, philosopher and poet of Islam who lived from 904 to 979. The portal, inner dome and arcade date from the 16th century, when his holy reputation attracted a cemetery.  Also visit to Chorsu bazaar – the biggest, spice-smelling farmers bazaar' in Tashkent.
				Lunch at local restaurant. 
After lunch drive to Zangi Ota complex, consisting of Zangi Ota and Ambar Bibi Mausoleums, which is 15 km from Tashkent.  Zangi Ota or “father of life” was the dark-skinned Sheikh Ay Khodja, a 13-century Sufic preacher and patron saint of shepherds.
Legend records how Tamerlane was rebuilding Yasawi's mausoleum in the late 14 century but a wall repeatedly collapsed. Yasawi appeared to him in a dream, entreating that Zangi Ota be honored first, so Tamerlane had workers pass bricks along a great line from Turkestan to Tashkent. The two mausoleums date from that time, when Tashkent was a Timurid fortress.

				text: `After breakfast at the hotel transfer to Chernyaevka (Uzbek-Kazakh border). After border formalities transfer to Turkestan (400 km). Visit Akhmad Yasawi complex (16 century). Sufi saint Hazret Sultan Khodja Akhmad Yasawi was born in Sairam near Chimkent in 1103, but moved to Yasi after losing his father at the age of seven. There his mentor was the famous Sheikh Arslanbob. Legend holds that when Muhammed was dying he called, “Who will take my amanat (a persimmon stone, the symbol of Islam) and continue my ideas?” Arslanbob, already 300 years old and familiar with 33 religion but now recognizing Islam alone, volunteered and won Allah's approval. As he wandered the steppe 500 years later, Arslanbob met a boy of eleven, who demanded “Aksakal (white beard), give me my amanat!” He was, of course, young Akhmad. After Arslanbob's death, Akhmad became a disciple of a renowned Sufic sheikh in Bukhara, earning the right to explain “the way to the understanding of the truth”. He succeeded his teacher in 1160, before returning to Yasi to develop his own concept of the tariqat, the path to God. Legend also enfolds the close of Yassawi's life, when, aged 63, out of mourning for Muhammed who died at that age, he retreated to a subterranean cell to preach out his days. The small mausoleum erected for him in 1166 drew many pilgrims as dervish disciples of the Yassawiya Sufic brotherhood spread his mystical doctrine and didactic poetry across the steppes, later reaching Persia and Anatolia. The strength of Sufism survived the Mongol onslaught to promote the conversion of Mongol rulers to Islam. By Tamerlane's time, Yasi's population had expanded with pilgrims, priests, merchants and craftsmen, while the mausoleum's riches attracted frequent looting. The great conqueror ordered reconstruction work in 1394 and, on a 1397 visit, en route to receive a Mongol bride, gave exact instructions for a new building on the magnificent scale of the Ak Saray in Shakhrisabz or Bibi Khanum in Samarkand. His pious action not only won favor by increasing the splendor for pilgrims and revenue for residents, it also set forth a tangible proclamation of Timurid power at the imperial borders. Yasawi's reputation was such that a three-time pilgrimage equaled a trip to Mecca. He was called Hazreti Turkestan, the patron of the land of the Turks, and thus the town received its modern name. Once the khan of Kokand took the town in the 19 century, the mausoleum was turned into a 
				wall-wrapped fortress. Before his death, Yasawi is said to have predicted the invasion of an ill-defined enemy in 1864. Right on time came the Russians and only the mullah's surrender saved the mausoleum from their artillery.
