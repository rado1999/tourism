After the Koran, the book most revered by Muslims is the collection of Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammed) selected by, among others, Abu Abdullah Muhammed ibn Ismail Imam Al-Bukhori. Born in Bukhara in 810, the young boy showed a precocious talent for memorizing the traditions of Muhammed. At 16 he accompanied his mother and brother in the hadj pilgrimage to Mecca. They returned home without him, for Al-Bukhori was set on his chosen task of roaming the Islamic world in search of Hadith. His 97-book masterpiece took 16 years to compile from over 600,000 traditions, gathered from over 1000 sheikhs. He would not insert a text without first washing and praying. In addition to Muhammed's life, Al-Bukhori explained the creation of heaven and hell. Though his veracity and peerless knowledge were recognized in his lifetime, his popularity and independent spirit drew enemies in Persia that forced him back to Bukhara. Al-Bukhori wished to keep learning open to all who attended his mosque, so he refused private tuition for the Bukharian governor's children. His subsequent expulsion brought him to the village of Hartang outside Samarkand. Depressed by his treatment, the old master was heard one night in 870 to pray for God to release him. Within a month he was dead.

				text: `After late breakfast visit Old Tashkent and Kukeldash Madrassah will be the first to see. Built in the mid-16th century by the ruler's vizier Kukaldash, the madrassah was the biggest among 17 madrassahs in Tashkent. The Madrassah was built in very traditional style, just so any madrassah is built in any Muslim country.  After secular use as a Soviet warehouse and museum, the madrassah is reasserting religious role. Next to Kukeldash Madrassah there are three renewed domes – reconstructed city's chief Friday Mosque, named after Khodja Akhrar (1404-1490) – Chief Sheikh of powerful Sufic order of Naqshbandi. Original mosque was built in 15 century on the highest point in old Tashkent and was the third biggest in Central Asia. Afterward drive to Kukcha district and visit the oldest architectural Islamic monument in Tashkent – Mausoleum of Zaynutdun Bobo.  Sheikh Zaynutdin was a son of famous in Muslim world philosopher and poet Shikhabuddin as-Sukhravardi, direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammed. Zaynutdin was born in Bagdad in 1214. In the middle of 13 century he moved to Tashkent and as legend says lived in subterranean cell (chillya khona) in Kuhi Arifon (Hill of wise men) village near Tashkent. Sheikh Zaynutdin was much respected and after his death a mausoleum was erected. His mausoleum was reconstructed and rebuilt many times due to earthquakes. The building, which can be seen now, was built in 16 century, but the subterranean cell was built much earlier, in 12th century. Also visit Khast Imam Square – the holy heart of Tashkent and the least Russified or Sovietized part of the city – consisting of Barak Khan Madrassah, Tillya Sheykh Mosque and Kafal Shashi Mausoleum. Barak Khan founded in the 16th century by a descendent of Tamerlane who ruled Tashkent for the Shaybanid dynasty. This is the administrative center of the Mufti of Uzbekistan, the head of official Islam in the Republic. Tillya Sheykh mosque built in the same time as Barak Khan Madrassah, now employed as the district's Friday Mosque. The highlight is the immense Osman Koran, claimed to be the world's oldest; in 655 it was stained with the blood of the murdered Caliph Osman. Kafal Shashi mausoleum – the grave of a local doctor, philosopher and poet of Islam who lived from 904 to 979. The portal, inner dome and arcade date from the 16th century, when his holy reputation attracted a cemetery.  Also visit to Chorsu bazaar – the biggest, spice-smelling farmers bazaar' in Tashkent.
					Lunch at local restaurant. 
	After lunch drive to Zangi Ota complex, consisting of Zangi Ota and Ambar Bibi Mausoleums, which is 15 km from Tashkent.  Zangi Ota or “father of life” was the dark-skinned Sheikh Ay Khodja, a 13-century Sufic preacher and patron saint of shepherds.
	Legend records how Tamerlane was rebuilding Yasawi's mausoleum in the late 14 century but a wall repeatedly collapsed. Yasawi appeared to him in a dream, entreating that Zangi Ota be honored first, so Tamerlane had workers pass bricks along a great line from Turkestan to Tashkent. The two mausoleums date from that time, when Tashkent was a Timurid fortress.

				text: `After breakfast at the hotel transfer to Chernyaevka (Uzbek-Kazakh border). After border formalities transfer to Turkestan (400 km). Visit Akhmad Yasawi complex (16 century). Sufi saint Hazret Sultan Khodja Akhmad Yasawi was born in Sairam near Chimkent in 1103, but moved to Yasi after losing his father at the age of seven. There his mentor was the famous Sheikh Arslanbob. Legend holds that when Muhammed was dying he called, “Who will take my amanat (a persimmon stone, the symbol of Islam) and continue my ideas?” Arslanbob, already 300 years old and familiar with 33 religion but now recognizing Islam alone, volunteered and won Allah's approval. As he wandered the steppe 500 years later, Arslanbob met a boy of eleven, who demanded “Aksakal (white beard), give me my amanat!” He was, of course, young Akhmad. After Arslanbob's death, Akhmad became a disciple of a renowned Sufic sheikh in Bukhara, earning the right to explain “the way to the understanding of the truth”. He succeeded his teacher in 1160, before returning to Yasi to develop his own concept of the tariqat, the path to God. Legend also enfolds the close of Yassawi's life, when, aged 63, out of mourning for Muhammed who died at that age, he retreated to a subterranean cell to preach out his days. The small mausoleum erected for him in 1166 drew many pilgrims as dervish disciples of the Yassawiya Sufic brotherhood spread his mystical doctrine and didactic poetry across the steppes, later reaching Persia and Anatolia. The strength of Sufism survived the Mongol onslaught to promote the conversion of Mongol rulers to Islam. By Tamerlane's time, Yasi's population had expanded with pilgrims, priests, merchants and craftsmen, while the mausoleum's riches attracted frequent looting. The great conqueror ordered reconstruction work in 1394 and, on a 1397 visit, en route to receive a Mongol bride, gave exact instructions for a new building on the magnificent scale of the Ak Saray in Shakhrisabz or Bibi Khanum in Samarkand. His pious action not only won favor by increasing the splendor for pilgrims and revenue for residents, it also set forth a tangible proclamation of Timurid power at the imperial borders. Yasawi's reputation was such that a three-time pilgrimage equaled a trip to Mecca. He was called Hazreti Turkestan, the patron of the land of the Turks, and thus the town received its modern name. Once the khan of Kokand took the town in the 19 century, the mausoleum was turned into a 
					wall-wrapped fortress. Before his death, Yasawi is said to have predicted the invasion of an ill-defined enemy in 1864. Right on time came the Russians and only the mullah's surrender saved the mausoleum from their artillery.

According to Al Makdisi Abiverd was richer and more fertile than Parthian Nisa. Its shakhristan was surrounded by perimeter by the walls with rounded towers and the moat. A straight street connected the only town gates with the gates of the citadel. The Mausoleum of Abu Said Makneyi was built in 11th century and has the double dome that characterises mausoleums of that time. The inner part of the mausoleum is decorated with inscriptions while the portal is laced with mosaics. The mosaics offer various colours and pictures to the viewer.

We start off our first day with a late morning stroll through the city centre and a visit of the row of newly built monuments and fountains at the outskirts of this unusual city. The most fascinating monument is probably the Arch of Neutrality featuring a 12 m gold statue of Turkmenistan's First President, Saparmurat Turkmenbashi. We lunch at the Altyn Asyr, the fountain of the 'Golden Century' with a splendid view of the Kopetdag Mountains getting our first impression of the this unusual country. After a rest at the hotel we continue with a visit a family of silk makers in a private house nearby the city centre. Traditionally the Keteni-Silk woven by the various Turkmen tribes is much harder than other silks in the region and unlike the Uzbek and Tadjik Ikat the thread is dyed separately before preparation of the warp. Keteni has undergone some very positive recent revival and curious evolutions and is again worn by Turkmen women and girls on most festive occasions. With a cup of tea we will watch the entire processing of the dying, threading, warp preparation and the actual weaving. Afterwards we visit Ashgabat's most excellent mosque with its outstanding calligraphies and dine at an outside restaurant.`,

In their symbolism and ornamentals Turkmenistan's carpets, (commonly known throughout the world as Bukhara rugs), its Palas- and its Chuval-weavings represent some of the most important national symbols and roots of the cultural heritage of the country. During your visit to the museum and to the carpet workshop later in the afternoon you will be introduced to the ancient history and evolution of the art of weaving and knitting of Turkmenistan's tribes.After lunch and siesta we continue with a traditional carpet workshop and later on to the first holy shrine we visit on our trip. Shrine pilgrimage forms an important part of Turkmen culture and has been preserved throughout the Soviet period to an extraordinary level uncommon to the otherwise traditionally more Islamic region. At the Namazaga mausoleums and shrines, some 15 km west of Ashgabat you will witness some of the strongest traditions of the various cults of fertility and fire all performed under an Islamic cover. The mainly female pilgrims to the shrine evolve in various cults of stone rubbing and turning, visioning, mud throwing and prostration throughout different parts of the building structure, which have been adapted to these most honest and beautiful traditions for centuries. There are over 1,000 such shrines in Turkmenistan some of which we visit on our trip.After visiting the Shrine we continue across the ragged roads before the foothills of the Kopetdag to Nissa Fortress - once an important base of the Parthian Empire (247 BC - 253 AD), stretching from the Kopetdag all the way across to the Persian gulf and Anatolia. With the first excavations in the early 20th century the 14 ha walled territory is one of the most important capital settlements of this early, little-known, wine-loving culture with a strong blend of Greek and Oriental influences. Apart from the ruins of the various temples and treasuries its proudest finds are the famous ivory Rithons, cult drinking vessels that are unique to this picturesque site and which we will see at the National Museum later throughout our voyage. We dine at another of Ashgabat mainly Turkish restaurants and enjoy the facilities of our excellent hotel.`,

Here the former Empire of Khorezm, once one of the Great Powers along the Silk Road, stretches both on Turkmen and Uzbek territory. With a unique language forming a mix of the Turkmen Northern Yomud dialects, Karakalpak and western Uzbek the friendly people of this area have preserved a strong tradition and with its link to the Amudarya canal systems a relatively urban culture. Donkey carts and roof hay stacks on the large farm houses are as typical to the area as are the mainly Uzbek colours in the silk dress of many of the Khorezm women.We spend the first day in the outskirts of the regional capital, Dashogus (formerly Tashauz), where we visit a Dutar maker and a carpenter - both arts being of very regional strong tradition.Further we visit another of the country's ancient cities Izmukshir or Zamakshar dating back to the 3rd c. BC and the ruins of which stretch over an enormous territory covered by tamarisk bushes and terracotta shreds some 10 km out of Dashogus.We dine at a local Korean restaurant and stay at the best Hotel in town.`,

This UN-World-Heritage site is by far Turkmenistan's visually most impressive one featuring the tallest minaret of Central Asia, the Gutlug Timur and and with Turabeg Khanum one of the most philosophical and earliest cupolas of the Islamic world. The characteristic conic cupolas and the quality of the tile-work of the various mausoleums remain unique for their age and preservation throughout the Orient. After visiting the monuments we embark on our long journey across the Karakum desert - the "Black Desert", not for its colour but for its reputation as one of the fiercest deserts in the world. After the last ancient outposts of Khorezm some 80 km south of Konye Urgench we enter the typical desert territory of dunes grown over by sparse saxaul and acacia trees and salt marshes that the locals call 'Takyrs'. The rough asphalt road leads through the territories that had once been inhabited by the slave trading warring Turcoman tribes and lets its visitor drowse into the times of ancient explorers and espionage.We reach the first oasis after a 280 km drive across the practically uninhabited land. Here at Darvaza Oasis the nomadic heritage of this remote country has survived almost perfectly. Most of the families set up traditional Summer yurts in front their simple houses. Life revolves around the sheep and the camel, which seem to be present almost everywhere. We spend the night in traditional yurts and tents near a chaykhana road-inn on the outside of the village and taste the traditional home-cooked dishes.`,

We are usually greeted by the village elders, the "Aksakal", with their long beards and enormous fur hats, the Telpek, worn as a sign of wisdom and protection against the intense sunlight. The elders, both men and also women have a lot of authority in these rural villages and their decisions are respected as the law. It is here in the desert where we can witness the interesting role of the women as the main work power and despite a superficial suppression a powerful voice in the world of clan and family. We continue along the slightly better road to the next oasis, Erbent, where we enjoy a traditional roadside lunch of the national Daurama bread soup and visit a felt making family. The various felts ornaments from each Turkmen village and clan are different to each other and most of them of very ancient origin and symbolism. Only the core pattern of the scorpion tail and the horns of the ram are repeated throughout all tribes. We watch the entire process from the layout of the pattern to the tremendous work of the manual rolling of the wet felt by 2-3 women. Resting in the shade of the few trees amongst the yurts and shacks we are also shown the almost forgotten tradition of bread making in the ashes of a fire. The oasises here in the Central Karakum are also home to the Tazy dogs - a beautiful Turkmen hunting breed similar in shape to Afghan dogs. We continue in the late afternoon to Ashgabat where we enjoy the Diwan Hotel and a dinner at the Italian restaurant.`,

The Russian bazaar with its colourful display of fruits and vegetables is by far the best market in the country. Shopping and bargaining in the bazaar is an important part of the oriental culture and the saleswomen are very friendly and most curious to talk to. Amongst the delicacies - depending on the season you will find huge divine pink tomatoes, enormous juicy pomegranates, 1000's of different fragrant sweet melons, roasted apricot kernels and excellent smoked sturgeon. After lunch in the afternoon we visit a private Akhal Teke stud farm in outside of Ashgabat. The Akhal Teke horse is another national symbol and is depicted in the centre of Turkmenistan's coat of arms. The exotically beautiful, extravagantly graceful and versatile Akhal-Teke horse was, until recently not well known outside of the former Soviet Union. This most unusual breed of riding horse, highly regarded for its speed, stamina, comfortable gaits, intelligence and trainability, is currently enjoying a well-deserved surge of popularity outside of its traditional homeland of Turkmenistan and neighbouring Russia. ornaments clearly identify each tribe and clan.

At the beginning of our we drive we visit Anau Mosque, another important place of worship for pilgrims on the grounds of the ruins of Ashgabat's formerly most splendid mosque. The pre-islamic history of the site has recently been recognised in the world news for a unique find of a bronze age seal. The inscriptions on this tiny seal found in 2,000 possibly display hieroglyphs of an unknown antique language. This spectacular find may indeed be another confirmation for the existence of a sophisticated fire worshipping culture in the foothills of the Kopetdag some 3,500 to 4,000 years ago challenging the writing of early history of human cultures.From Anau we continue detouring to the Mausoleum of Meane Baba. is the mausoleum of one of the greatest Sufi teachers and philosophers of the 11th century, Abu Sahyt and said to have very strong magic powers. The tile-work on the entrance portal is highly remarkable and so are the simple floral designs on the inner cupola and sidewalls. With its two caretakers from the holy Ata tribe the Mausoleum serves as another important place of pilgrimage as the tiny cradles and material shreds, which are placed around the tomb by women wishing fertility, indicate. After a lunch picnic at the shrine guesthouse we continue to Mary city where we relax at the guesthouse.Before dinner in preparation of our visit of Merv, which we visit the next day, we visit the extraordinary Mary Museum, with one of the best ethnographic and archaeological collections in Central Asia. The upper floor boasts an extensive permanent display of Turkmen ethnography with additional sections on the Baluch and early Russian involvement in this region. On the ground floor the new permanent exhibition of partially unpublished archaeological material mostly displays finds from excavations at the Bronze Age sites in the northern part of the Merv oasis, or various Sasanian-Islamic discoveries at Merv.

In order to reach this relatively remote area we leave Ashgabat westwards at first passing by the Geok Tepe mosque. The Mosque with a beautiful turquoise dome was build recently on the ruins of the former fortress with the same name - the place of the last resistance of the Turcoman tribes against the Russian annexation in 1881. We continue further to the site the mystical place of Murche, located 118 km to the west of Ashgabat. This site is an ancient village in the foothills of the Kopetdag Mountains filled with ancient ruins, mysticism, and deities. In Murche, which is another holy place we visit once we witness tribal traditions performed with mysterious offerings to pagan deities and hear of unexplained natural phenomena such as light radiating from an archaic burial site. Also in Murche is the Mausoleum of Zengi-Baba who is in Indo-Iranian mythology a reflection of Mithra, the ancient god of sun. Eventually this cult spread beyond Iran and Asia Minor and gradually became a mystery cult. From Murche we continue by a different off-road bus into the mountainous Nokhur region.With almost Indian indo-european features and very entrepreneurial life-style the Nokhur tribe has preserved a unique tradition of handicrafts and architecture in their villages. Outstanding carpentry and unusual stone-houses are characteristic for their hillside villages amidst picturesque pomegranate and almond orchards. During the next few days we will experience extraordinary hospitality and see extraordinary handicraft and landscapes. On the first day we stroll through the tiny alleyways of the main village.

Most of the elder women here are still proudly wearing the traditional Chirpy overcoat and especially elder and newly wed women will at least take their scarf into the mouth to veil herself before the outsider. We visit once more the silk-makers before lunching at a private house - feasting on typical Nokhur dishes.In the afternoon on our return drive we visit a felt hat maker and a holy spring before continuing along the main road to the shrine of Paraw Bibi. This shrine is one of the most impressive and popular sites of pilgrimage in the country. It is located in western Turkmenistan approximately 20 km northwest of Gizilarbat in the village of Paraw. The actual shrine is set some 100 meters up a rocky mountainside overlooking the village and consists of a white mausoleum-like structure (described in historical sources as a mosque). Next to the shrine is an adjoining chamber with an outside entrance. We stay at the foot of the mountain in the simple guesthouse with shared rooms where pilgrims congregate and have meals.
